		        <h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>Lately various web based accessibility enhancement, remediation, and reporting services have been made available to web content providers under the term: <q>Overlay.</q>
			Typically these function by adding a snippet of JavaScript into a web content provider&apos;s page. This single line of additional code functions to enable additional content processing on each page load delivered through
			the overlay provider&apos;s servers,  before the content is delivered to the end user. While this routing paradigm is by no means unique to accessibility applications, it does introduce accessibility opportunities and
			challenges.</p>

			<p>In this document we explore the specific capabilities that are, or could be,  applied for accessibility purposes whether by overlay technologies, browser extensions, plugins installed on user&apos;s devices and so on. Some of the capabilities explored here are already available and used in web content delivery systems today. Others suggest best practices guidance. Still others strike us as highly desirable, but will require the creation of a normative W3C specification, especially in the case of cross-platform functionality. As with the accessibility impact of any web technology, poor implementation will predictably yield unsatisfactory user experiences, while well-crafted solutions may significantly enhance the user&apos;s experience.</p>

		<h3>What is Meant By <q>Edge?</q></h3>

		<p>The term <q>edge technology</q> refers to that portion of the assembled presentation of web content most proximate to the content user. Typically it is:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The user agent (with its user chosen plugins and extensions) together with the host and physical device the user uses to read and interact with web content;</li>
			<li>But more powerfully (as we shall soon see), it is the last compositor of content delivered to the user. It is of course cloud-based. And, while it might not be geographically proximate to the user, it functions most powerfully when it functions as the user&apos;s proxy agent for organizing web content in the manner the user is best able to use.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Both of these are privileged positions providing access to much information about the user and how the user functions. Much of what we discuss in this document assumes a trusted (and trustable) relationship with and on behalf of the user. Though we recognize the trust relationship inherent in edge positioned technology is today more honored in the breach, we choose to explore the tremendous accessibility opportunities available when this trust relationship is rather honored in the observance.</p>

	        <h3>Web Content Today is Dynamic</h3>

		  <p>In the main the classic paradigm of a web domain owner serving content directly to end users across the Internet has long ago become a historical artifact.
		    Today&apos;s typical web page is often a dizzying composite of multiple content streams injected from various sources, including content unique to the user&apos;s locale and even to the specific user herself. Content
		    delivered to a user today may be a unique <q>one-off</q> composite that may well change when the page is refreshed. The <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/third-parties">2021 Web Almanac</a> notes more
		    than 20 third party injection streams for today&apos;s typical web site, with 10% containing over 90 separate content injections.</p>

		    <p>The source of the typical website
		    today is actually many sources.

		    Even bespoke web applications aren&apos;t always created by a single
		    source. Few developers exclusively use their own code. They rely on
		    libraries, components and frameworks to build their plugins.</p>
		    
		    <p> Edge technologies may actually be best placed to help overcome the problem
		    of substandard accessibility in composite content delivered to end users by identifying precisely the accessibility challenges that end users may experience and helping remediate them where it matters most&mdash;at the user
		    level, for the simple reason that technology based tracking and reporting can examine far more end user payload deliveries than human testing will ever cover. In particular we consider the role played by various edge-based players beginning with the Content Delivery Network (CDN), the operating system on the user&apos;s devices, user-agent, browser extensions, assistive technologies, and/or JavaScript overlays.  Whether the resulting remediation is an in-process transformation,
		    or an upstream recoding, gathering and reporting many samples to upstream end points is arguably the most efficient way to spot anomalous patterns (and a great application for <a>A-I</a> analysis).</p>

			<h3>About This Document</h3>

	     <p>This document describes some capabilities important to web content accessibility that can be provided <q>at the edge</q>, and attempts to answer several questions about them. The questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source: What is the role of the author (or content source code developer) in providing this capability and ensuring that it is accessible?</li>

<li>Trade-offs: When this capability is enabled on the edge, does it duplicate functionality elsewhere in the stack? When we find  redundancies, we ask whether they can and should be avoided?</li>

<li>Benefit: What is the potential benefit of performing this capability at the edge?</li>

<li>Related topics: Draw attention to capabilities that are related in some way, e.g. perhaps they&apos;re mutually enhancing, or perhaps they are the prospective benefit of a normative cross-platform behavior specification.</li>
</ul>

	<p>The capabilities discussed are organized under two primary categories with several subcategories under each primary section. This two-poled approach conforms with client-server architecture, the backbone of all digital transactions and interactions that take place over the Internet. The primary categories are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Capabilities the end user can (or should) be able to control fully.</li>
		<li>Capabilities which are necessarily controlled by the content provider even though they can profoundly affect the accessibility experience.</li>
	</ul>

<p>The Content Provider, analogous to the server, plays the pivotal role of specifying and delivering diverse forms of digital content ranging from text, images, audio, video, to interactive elements. They curate the experiences that users consume and engage with, thereby shaping the digital landscape.

A selection of some primary Content Provider roles:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Role</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Author</td>
    <td>Responsible for generating the primary content, be it text, script for audio/video, or conceptual outlines for interactive elements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Designer</td>
    <td>Work on the aesthetic aspects of the content including the layout, color scheme, typography, and visual elements. They also handle the user interface and user experience design for interactive content.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product Owner</td>
    <td>Oversee the overall content creation and distribution project, make key decisions and coordinate between different teams to ensure the final product meets its intended objectives.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Developer</td>
    <td>Implement the designs into functional code. They work on the website or application where the content will be hosted, ensuring its responsive, functional, and accessible. Some write proprietary algorithms, but most call and configure frameworks and libraries written by communities of coders.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Marketer</td>
    <td>Oversee and implement the marketing strategy for the content. They coordinate marketing campaigns and work closely with other teams to ensure the content reaches the desired audience. Growth marketers utilize data-driven marketing techniques to help the business expand its customer base. They use various strategies and tools to attract, engage, and retain users driving critical website requirements.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>On the other end of the spectrum is the End User, or the client, who experiences this digital content. End users span a wide range, varying in their demographic, cognitive, and physical attributes. They also bring to the table their unique needs, preferences, and accessibility requirements. It is for these users that content providers shape their digital content and experiences, with or without the knowledge that the user&apos;
s own hardware and software may render it in ways the Content Provider never imagined. </p>

<P>Content sites are inherently dynamic; they are assembled for the end-user in a mashup, a unique blend of content that can vary significantly from user to user. A selection of some of the hardware, software, tools and technologies that participate in this edge activity include:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Technology</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>User-Agent (Browser)</td>
    <td>Interprets and presents web content to the end user. Different browsers may render web content in slightly different ways due to their different rendering engines.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Assistive Technology</td>
    <td>Devices or software applications that assist individuals with disabilities or impairments. This could include screen readers, alternative input devices, and voice recognition software.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Browser Extension</td>
    <td>An add-on or plugin that extends the functionality of a web browser. Could alter the appearance of web content, block advertisements, or add additional features to a webpage. Includes mashup tools or web services that combine content from more than one source into a single integrated experience. These can greatly modify the original content and how it is presented to the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OS or Software Application</td>
    <td>A program or group of programs running on the local operating system. Applications can vary drastically in purpose, from productivity apps to entertainment apps, and can influence how digital content is accessed and interacted with.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Video/Audio System</td>
    <td>Hardware and software components that control the output of video and sound.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Content Delivery Network</td>
    <td>Store copies of web content in various locations around the world to reduce the physical distance between the server and the user, improving site performance. This intermediary, typically invisible to the end user, plays a critical role in delivery and updating of digital content, as well as authenticating users.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>This two-poled digital communication model is not a one-way broadcast, but a dynamic conversation. Feedback from end users can influence and improve the content generated by providers, while content providers continuously adapt their strategies based on user behavior and needs. The feedback loops become more complex as edge technologies come into play.

<h2>Reset All Personalizations</h2>

<p>It is only smart business practice and simple courtesy to support a <q>one button click</q> feature to reset any user
triggered enhancement and restore the page to its default state. It should be as easy as possible for users to try different settings and undo them readily. Similarly, it should be just as easy to undo any auto-applied transformations and return a page to the settings provided directly by source. Users should be empowered to adjudge for themselves whether any applied overlay transformation actually enhances their ability to interact&mdash;and to return the overlay enhancements should they discover they&apos;re actually enhancing their experience, contrary to initial doubt!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
This applies to source provided transformations just as much as it applies to edge provided overlay transformations.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>
	As previously noted some content publishers offer accessibility related page transformation overlays in their source. As also previously noted, the drawback with source provided transformations is that they must be applied over and over, site by site. If indeed a user discovers different settings are needed for different sites, this may appear to argue for not interfering with user chosen settings on a site by site basis.

These are the capabilities described by the fundamentalWCAG principle: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility"><q>operable</q></a>.

	<h2>Structural Semantics Remediation</h2>

	<p>WCAG explains in painstaking detail the critical importance to accessibility of structural markup. It is a fundamental requirement and any means to remediate or improve missing structural markup provides an immediate functional enhancement to users whose accessibility accommodations rely on explicit structural semantics.</p>

<section id="structure">
	<h3>Expose Structural Semantics</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
It has long been agreed that published content should contain structural markup as provided by HTML and explained by WCAG. Not only is this critical for accessibility, additional processing to further tailor content presentation to particular user needs will rely on proper structural markup, preferably provided by source content.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>
	There is no inherent value to creating structural markup in edge technology. Doing so is clearly a remedial action to close a critical gap. On the other hand and as previously noted content delivered to end users today is most frequently a composite mashup of multiple input streams and not the simple delivery of content from a single source repository. The very act of mashing together multiple streams introduces a likelihood of semantic incoherency. The very word itself, <q>mashup,</q> strongly suggests a lack of concern for the coherency of the ultimate composite as delivered to the end user. Thus, anything that can be done to introduce greater semantic coherency is of benefit to all users, and especially those users relying on accessibility supporting features such as coherent and explicit structure. Lastly, as also previously noted, emerging strategies to further tailor content interaction to particular user&apos;s interaction preferences will rely on good structural markup, and these adaptations will, necessarily, be produced in edge technologies.
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>
	Whether as a temporary remedial expedient or the advanced personalization adaptation now emerging from W3C accessibility standards, or somewhere in between, users simply deserve the best structural semantics that can be provided them in the moment when they seek to interact with web content. Any and all philosophical <q>should</q> arguments must give way to this simple rubric.
</dd>
</dl>

</section>

<section id="structnorm">
	<h3>Normalize the Structural Composite</h3>

	<p>
	Many users with accessibility needs rely heavily on consistency in the user interface. Yet no standard exists, nor is likely ever to require certain common controls be located consistently across sites. This is very much in the design prerogative of the individual content publisher. And, while individual sites may be fully consistent in where they locate controls on the pages they publish, the user who comparison shops will encounter a different site consistently locating the same controls differently. The publisher has done nothing wrong, but the user is forced to rely on a perfect memory or put up with time-consuming strategies for locating these controls. Consider this example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The user needs to make a reservation on a travel site and will shop several sites to compare offers.</li>
		<li>Necessarily this involves picking (or specifying) dates.</li>
		<li>Typically a starting date is specified first.</li>
		<li>At this point the user needs to locate the control for switching to the specification of the end date.</li>
		<li>Where is it on this site? Is it at the upper right? The lower left? Some other location on screen on this particular site which is different from other sites the user has searched?</li>
		<li>Note that that swiping on a touch-screen may easily miss encountering these controls, especially when swiping forward into future dates. Swiping focus will remain in the date-picker widget</li>
		<li>Searching for these controls risks activating a control irrelevant to the current task such as a notification screen. This further complicates the user&apos;s predicament and wastes yet more of the user&apos;s time.</li>
	</ul>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
	By definition this conundrum cannot be resolved by a source content publisher.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>
	None. Only an edge technology can hope to ameliorate the situation.
</dd>

<dd>
	The means of navigation is not offered by source. 
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>
	This additional navigation aide would not block or hinder other types of access; the only trade-off could be confusion of having an excessive number of choices. Having a sheer volume of options can be mentally exhausting to some. 
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>The "curb cut effect" is used to describe a situation where accommodations made to assist people with disabilities end up benefiting everyone. The ability to browse pages by structural semantic features such as headings, links, or buttons promises to allow users to quickly move between different sections or elements of a web page without the need to visually scan the entire page. This can save time, especially on long and complex pages with lots of content. By using semantic navigation options like headings or links, sighted users can easily jump to specific sections or pieces of content they are interested in. This can be particularly helpful when users are looking for specific information or trying to locate a particular topic on a page. 
	<p>Some users rely on keyboard navigation alone, such as those with motor disabilities or certain types of visual impairments.

<section id="FormLabel">
<h3>Form Labels</h3>

		<p>Forms are the fundamental interface of the interactive web.

Furthermore, consistent grouping and form controls on screen location is also critical.</p>

		<dl>
		<dt>Source</dt>
		<dd>
		Far too many sites fail to use available markup to associate date entry fields and status selection control widgets with the labels the print to screen. These sites expect non-disabled users will simply understand what label applies to what field and widget by virtue of how the two are printed to screen. The user who relies on programmatic association is thus disadvantaged. The problem is amplified by the use and re-use of frameworks and low code forms that lack this support.
		</dd>
		<dt>Trade-offs</dt>

				There is, of course, the other application, where violation detection serves as a step in a source remediation process. We address the former here.</p>
			<dl>
			<dt>Source</dt>
			<dd>
			If source got this right (as WCAG 2.x seems to expect), we wouldn&apos;t have a need for this capability.
			</dd>
			<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
			<dd>In-browser scanners and online scanners are used to detect WCAG violations. 
				This is the business model for many companies. 
				False positives, false negatives, certainty and confidence scores are well-known factors affecting the success and usefulness of this approach. 
				It is unfortunate when such violations remain unremediated in source content, but sometimes this can&apos;t be helped. 
				An indication of violations at the edge, however rough, is better than none.
			</dd>
			<dt>Benefit</dt>
			<dd>
				Large, complex and highly dynamic source sites are literally unable to reproduce every user experience permutation in their test beds. Automated detection and 
				reporting can help bridge this gap. 
				Something is most often better than nothing, especially in the moment. 
				It looms ever larger as it stacks, and automated detection is often the first step in a chain of capabilities.

<h3>Human Mediated Automated Remediation</h3>

		<p>While not the glamorous <q>holy grail</q> of technology deployment today, human mediation of A-I identified checkpoints, together with the site owner&apos;s active participation to clarify meaning and intent, describes an effective approach to accomplish accessibility remediations where they&apos;re needed. No other approach delivers equally effective remediations at such scale.
		</p>

		<dl>
		<dt>Source</dt>
		<dd>
			This is a process approach just as meaningful for remediating accessibility violations in source as it is for remediating at the edge. Though to argue any remediation <strong>not</strong> done at source or <strong>not</strong> performed by a human, may describe a theology of accessibility, not a technological solution delivering real benefits to users.
		</dd>
		<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
		<dd>
			It is clearly preferable to remediate violations in source content whenever doing so is feasible. An in-process corrective overlay remediations only make sense when there are good reasons why the source cannot be remediated. 
		</dd>
		<dt>Benefit</dt>
		<dd>
			The user always benefits when best available remediation approaches are employed. Nor will the user ever care where and how the remediation is accomplished as long as it facilitates the user&apos; s ability to function.

<h3>Accessibility Editing, By Site Owner</h3>

		<p>This capability describes an interface in the overlay,

		<dl>

			Where the source lacks sufficient accessibility supporting markup, this capability provides both analytics and remediation access to properly authenticated 
		persons empowered to perform remediation. Note the assumption is that, for whatever reason, the content technology provided by the hosting environment lacks adequate accessibility supporting technology.
		</dd>
		<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
		<dd>
		A properly configured content hosting environment should be able to accomplish accessible content publication. Such editing performed at the edge depends on robust IDs, and can be more brittle than changes at source.
		</dd>
		<dt>Benefit</dt>
		<dd>
			This capability facilitates adding missing accessibility supporting markup to source content. It is unique to overlays of this type, providing an alternative to standard methods of
			coding the site, either via source code, web platform templates/CSS
			adjustments, etc. This capability exists to assist sites who fail accessibility, usually for a complex set of reasons where source remediation is expensive or otherwise not readily achievable.
			This is not  a redundant capability. Rather, it is an innovation only available from edge technology. Equivalent technology in source would require the site publisher to establish a complete panoply of content management tooling. While this is certainly feasible, not everyone wishing to make content available on line desires to spend time gaining proficiency with content management systems.

<h3>Feature-Bundling Profiles</h3>

<p>Site publishers need to support the full spectrum of accessibility features. On the other hand individual users need certain features and will ignore those they do not need. The types of features individual users need are  often group-able

As previously noted, users will need the same (or very similar) feature support across all their various devices.

		<h2>Personalized & Portable Configuration Profiles</h2>

<h3>Configure Once, Use Everywhere</h3>

<p>Users now frequently use several devices. Furthermore, users tend to have the same or very similar accessibility requirements regardless of the device they may be using in the moment. 
	It is therefore an emerging goal in web accommodations to support the user in configuring once and having their configured preference propagate across all their devices. Such a cross-Device preference profile should ideally function across all vendors and operating environments.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>While technically feasible in source, this is not being done by content source today, and we are not aware of any proposals to add such functionality in content source&mdash;likely for a multiplicity of reasons.

	source providers outside of their knowledge or control.</dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt>

	Such a capability has long been desired and is arguably now more achievable than ever before. 
	It would  clearly be valuable to users. 
	For example, blind users and people on slow internet connections will benefit from setting their browsers to not download images. 
	It will nevertheless require nuanced implementation, e.g.  screen size and consequent decisions over preferred fonts, spacing, and contrasts  will likely vary by screen size and environmental conditions. 
	Another example of a nuanced consideration is the likely desire of a screen reader user to operate sometimes with TTS, but other times with braille (or both braille and TTS).

		<h1>Appendices</h1>

        <section class="appendix" id="Appendix-A">
		<h2>Design Principles</h2>

<p>Our approach to the design and analysis in this document is rooted in the principles often called: <q>Human-Centered
Design (HCD).</q> As an outlook that places people at its core, we believe HCD  aligns perfectly with the goals of accessibility. This method of design prioritizes empathy, collaboration, and user empowerment, which aligns with
our mission to generate accessibility solutions that meet the diverse needs of various human individuals. Our understanding of HCG requires us to minimize technological configuration tasks and maximize each individual&apos;s ability to read and interact with actual content&mdash;not the application (or browser) <q>chrome.</q></p>

		<p>Among various design terminologies linked with accessibility such as
		<q>universal design</q> and <q>inclusive design,</q> HCD sets itself apart due to some
		specific distinct attributes, such as:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>A focus on Individual Needs:</strong> HCD underscores the importance of comprehending
		the unique needs, preferences, and behaviors of individual users. It
		acknowledges that effective design solutions must address the broad
		spectrum of the human experience, catering to the specific requirements of
		different individuals. At the same time our goal is to allow individual users to focus on the features that assist them without needing to endlessly scroll through features that are the needs of other individuals.</li>

			<li><strong>User Empowerment:</strong> Central to the HCD approach is the active involvement of
		users throughout the design process. This approach appreciates their
		expertise, insights, and encourages co-creation, thereby fostering a sense
		of ownership and agency over the final outcome. As an example, in developing this document we actively solicit the input of individuals on whose behalf we endeavor to quantify and describe useful accessibility features. As with all W3C documents, transparency and wide public review are core values.</li>
		</ul>

<p>Our design philosophy does not merely aim for inclusivity; instead, it
		strives to create meaningful experiences that significantly enhance the
		lives of the people we serve. A successful application of HCD manifests not
		just in broad-reaching accessibility, but in generating rich, meaningful,
		and transformative experiences for the user.</p>

<p>Furthermore, HCD endeavors to build a comprehensive understanding of the
end user, transcending the confines of mere accessibility. It delves into
the emotional, cognitive, and social dimensions of the human experience,
with a commitment to design solutions that resonate on a profoundly
personal level.</p>

<p>Our commitment to HCD is woven throughout our efforts to ensure
accessibility. In prioritizing a user&apos;s individual needs and emphasizing
their active involvement in the design process, we believe we can create a
more accessible and inclusive digital environment. By employing HCD, we
hope to deliver a seamless, enjoyable experience for all users, that is
more than just accessible - it is truly human-centered.</p>

<h3>User-triggered Transformations</h3>

<p>User can be afforded  the opportunity to opt-in to various transformations via interactive personalization menus: The end-user can access a list of available enhancements and enable those they require. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Users tend to require the same types of accommodations across all sites and all content sources. Therefore, facilitating this capability in the source is likely the least useful place to locate it, because that would require the user to select the same enhancements time and again across the succession of sites visited and likely with different menu organization site to site. </dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>Many of the capabilities made available by user-triggered opt-ins are often also found in multiple places at the edge. For example, contrast adjustment is generally found  in operating system display settings, in browser and app user-agents (e.g. dark mode/light mode), and in browser extensions, and in JavaScripted (CDN hosted) overlays. Such redundancy can easily lead to confusion. This confusion may be further exacerbated because certain settings the user finds helpful may be available only in one of these locations, and not in all of them. Furthermore, users are frequently not particularly knowledgeable about their operating system settings menus, especially as these tend to move with each OS revision (to take one example). This can make it difficult to locate these features, especially when we recognize that once satisfactorily configured they are generally not reset (meaning that the user doesn&apos;t need to revisit that menu location and soon forgets where it is). On the other hand, locating the accommodation consistently proximate to the user offers the highest likelihood of maximal benefit provided  the accommodation  can be easily identified and invoked. This also provides the best opportunity for easing the burden of invoking the same accommodation across a user&apos;s multiple devices.</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Users can select and optimally tune the types of accommodations that they require. Any device on the edge may also have knowledge of other devices on the edge, that may need the same adjustments, and edge technology could propagate these settings to those other devices. MacOS Ventura (MacOS 13.2) is already doing this for Wi-Fi passwords when an IOS device configured for the same network is proximate.</dd>
